It’s both exciting and nerve-wracking when you move to a new country. It takes a lot of adjustment. Finding your way around town, what places you should be avoiding and where you can go for a nice afternoon lunch.  Most importantly of all is establishing yourself on a career path. 

When I moved to Manchester I was intimidated about the prospect of settling on a career. In the past I’d been drawn to statistics, economics, programming, game development, and engineering. I still felt like my choice would fall into those categories in some manner or other but I really didn’t know where to start. I couldn’t afford to go to school as I didn’t have access to any funding and the idea of working full-time while going to school full-time filled me with dread. The stress from just imagining what my day-to-day life would be like was already beginning to way down on me.   

I focused on getting a job in the mean time and kept looking at what options I had. I started teaching myself statistics again anticipating I might take my tests at the Royal Statistical Society, however, I still felt uneasy about the choice. I didn’t have my heart in it. 

It was later into my first year of being in Manchester that I decided to check out lynda.com for their programming courses, specifically C# and C. It appealed to me more than Code Academy due to the fact that there was a teacher. I could follow along with someone else working through the basics of programming. It felt like I was in a classroom again and I really enjoyed it. As I worked through a few videos I began to get annoyed that there wasn’t a set track to follow. I had no idea what I needed to learn next or how to gauge my knowledge and know when I was ready for more intermediate courses. That was when I happened to come across Treehouse.   

It was everything I wanted out of an online learning course. It had tons of languages to choose from which were attached to tracks. There was a whole community I could become apart of in the process where I could post questions or help people by offering solutions. I was able to gauge my knowledge by tracking my progress through a course which took me from learning the fundamentals to writing my first little application.  On top of all this was the access to industry talks, blogs, and talkshows. I found these hugely beneficial. For the first time I could listen to someone in the industry talking about what it takes to get a job as a developer, what their day-to-day consists of, best practices, etc. 

As I looked through the courses I could take I came across Ruby. I did some reading on it and was really attracted by how clean the syntax looked but how strong it could be. Best of all was the open source community that came along with it. This was a huge selling point for me as it meant I had somewhere to go when I wanted to talk to people about the language or contribute to a project when I felt capable. I wasn’t going to be lonely in my adventure. 

I was hooked. I came home after work and worked away every night learning about the basics of Ruby syntax. Becoming familiar with what methods were, using IRB, working with arrays and hashes, loops, objects, blocks, and especially Rails. I couldn’t get enough of it. I started learning the basics of other languages too like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I discovered how great Git is and how to query my SQL database.   

It was after a month of this that I read an article on Treehouse suggesting to find a local meet-up because it’d be a great way to meet new people who already work within the industry. I’d be able to get one-on-one time with actual developers and integrate myself into the Ruby community.   

After searching around I noticed there was one right in town called the North West Ruby User Group, NWRUG for short. They had a meeting coming up in two weeks which was going to be a “Hack night”. Initially I had no idea what this meant, what were we hacking? I was nervous and unsure of myself. I thought I’d have no way to contribute and that I’d be left out of the group on the night. 

Despite my own reservations I told myself I had to go, I had nothing to lose after all. I marked October the 15th down on my calendar and eagerly awaited the day when I would first expose myself to the developer community.
