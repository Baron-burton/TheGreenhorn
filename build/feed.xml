    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was at the evening of my first meet-up with NWRUG (North West Ruby User Group). I was excited. By encouraging myself to join this group I was opening myself up to a great deal of insight into what it takes to become a developer. I knew this was the start of something good for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  I walked into the building where the meet-up was being held (MadLab). On the first floor was NWRUG. I walked towards the table and as I began to set my things down I was quickly acknowledged and welcomed to the group. I was relieved that it was the members of the group who spoke up first because at the time I felt like I was in a completely alien environment. I almost didn’t want to introduce myself because I didn’t want to interrupt anyone’s conversation (the silly things you think when you’re meeting new people right?).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With it being a hack night and not having a computer I thought I’d quietly watch people work through the problems, just observe and absorb. The theme for the night was a cryptographic challenge, another thing I knew nothing about. As much as I was content with just sitting in the back for my first night the members of the group were keen to have me paired up so that I could have a go at the challenge.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal for the challenge was to use Ruby code to decrypt a message using two types of ciphers. Firstly, we were given an unreadable mass of letters that was encrypted using a Vigenere cipher and a mix of letters that had been encrypted using a Caesar cipher. We had to solve the Caesar cipher to reveal the keyword that would help solve our Vigenere cipher. So what are these ciphers? Good question!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Caesar cipher is a system of encryption wherein every occurrence of a particular letter is replaced by what is known as a cyphertext letter.Basically, you have two alphabets. In order to crack the Caesar cipher you need to know the shift associated with the cipher. For instance, a shift of 5 would mean the letter A in the cipher actually represents the letter F. You apply this shift to your coded text to reveal the secret message.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we had solved our the Caesar cipher it was on to the Vigenere. This particular cipher is quite tricky because there’s no simple one-to-one mapping of two texts. So how does it work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine that each letter of the alphabet represents a number starting with A = 0, B = 1, C = 2, etc. Knowing this we can then use a keyword to sneakily encrypt an entire message. As an example, let’s say our Caesar cipher keyword is “SURPRISE” and the message we want to encrypt is “Attack at first light”. Each letter of our keyword represents it’s own shifted alphabet so S is a shift of 18, U is a shift of 20 and so on. The trick is to apply the keyword on top of the text that you’re looking to encrypt like so;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keyword:  SURPRI SE  SURPR   ISESU 
Message:  ATTACK AT  FIRST   LIGHT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This results in the cipher: SNKPTS SX XCIHK TAKZN. Pretty neat!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although my teammate and I didn’t crack the final cipher, the night was still a resounding success for me. I was engrossed in trying to solve the problem and was having a blast failing and trying something new.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A thought that occurred to me on the night was that we were using the Ruby language in a way that I’d never even thought of. Previous to tonight, I thought that Ruby could only be used for specific things to do with web development, yet here we were messing around with cryptography challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That evening forced me to keep an open mind about the things I could try and do with Ruby code and definitely reiterated the fact that there was obviously so much more that I needed to learn. There was a long road ahead but I had now joined a friendly group of like minded people who I could learn from.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s both exciting and nerve-wracking when you move to a new country. It takes a lot of adjustment. Finding your way around town, what places you should be avoiding and where you can go for a nice afternoon lunch.  Most importantly of all is establishing yourself on a career path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I moved to Manchester I was intimidated about the prospect of settling on a career. In the past I’d been drawn to statistics, economics, programming, game development, and engineering. I still felt like my choice would fall into those categories in some manner or other but I really didn’t know where to start. I couldn’t afford to go to school as I didn’t have access to any funding and the idea of working full-time while going to school full-time filled me with dread. The stress from just imagining what my day-to-day life would be like was already beginning to way down on me.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I focused on getting a job in the mean time and kept looking at what options I had. I started teaching myself statistics again anticipating I might take my tests at the Royal Statistical Society, however, I still felt uneasy about the choice. I didn’t have my heart in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was later into my first year of being in Manchester that I decided to check out lynda.com for their programming courses, specifically C# and C. It appealed to me more than Code Academy due to the fact that there was a teacher. I could follow along with someone else working through the basics of programming. It felt like I was in a classroom again and I really enjoyed it. As I worked through a few videos I began to get annoyed that there wasn’t a set track to follow. I had no idea what I needed to learn next or how to gauge my knowledge and know when I was ready for more intermediate courses. That was when I happened to come across Treehouse.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was everything I wanted out of an online learning course. It had tons of languages to choose from which were attached to tracks. There was a whole community I could become apart of in the process where I could post questions or help people by offering solutions. I was able to gauge my knowledge by tracking my progress through a course which took me from learning the fundamentals to writing my first little application.  On top of all this was the access to industry talks, blogs, and talkshows. I found these hugely beneficial. For the first time I could listen to someone in the industry talking about what it takes to get a job as a developer, what their day-to-day consists of, best practices, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I looked through the courses I could take I came across Ruby. I did some reading on it and was really attracted by how clean the syntax looked but how strong it could be. Best of all was the open source community that came along with it. This was a huge selling point for me as it meant I had somewhere to go when I wanted to talk to people about the language or contribute to a project when I felt capable. I wasn’t going to be lonely in my adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was hooked. I came home after work and worked away every night learning about the basics of Ruby syntax. Becoming familiar with what methods were, using IRB, working with arrays and hashes, loops, objects, blocks, and especially Rails. I couldn’t get enough of it. I started learning the basics of other languages too like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I discovered how great Git is and how to query my SQL database.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was after a month of this that I read an article on Treehouse suggesting to find a local meet-up because it’d be a great way to meet new people who already work within the industry. I’d be able to get one-on-one time with actual developers and integrate myself into the Ruby community.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After searching around I noticed there was one right in town called the North West Ruby User Group, NWRUG for short. They had a meeting coming up in two weeks which was going to be a “Hack night”. Initially I had no idea what this meant, what were we hacking? I was nervous and unsure of myself. I thought I’d have no way to contribute and that I’d be left out of the group on the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite my own reservations I told myself I had to go, I had nothing to lose after all. I marked October the 15th down on my calendar and eagerly awaited the day when I would first expose myself to the developer community.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It takes a bit more courage than I imagined to write a blog post. I don’t have much experience writing anything that merits any consideration whatsoever, other than some work I did in university (this was barely considered by my professor). It’s intimidating to say the least. It’s difficult to tame your thoughts into a coherent text, let alone one that might be remotely enjoyable to read. Nevertheless, I push on!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My purpose for endeavouring to write a blog is to convey my experiences while learning to code. Learning to write code for the first time is daunting. Where do you begin? How do you know where you’re beginning is right? What dictates the amount of knowledge required to begin a new career? These are a few questions that I’ve asked myself. The answers to these questions change over time as new languages emerge and new portals of learning are created.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first thoughts were that it wouldn’t be possible to truly learn how to code without a degree in Computer Science, that becoming a software developer was reserved for a select few following a path carefully constructed by accomplished professors. Due to this, I thought it would also be impossible for me to get a job unless I started fresh in school. To my great surprise, I thought I’d discovered another way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started my journey a few years ago, not unlike many in this generation, with an online tutorial. The one in particular was CodeAcademy. It had a few languages to choose from (HTML and CSS were the first ones I picked), it didn’t require any setup, and, best of all, it was free! I was really excited. I came home from work and would practice for hours a night. It was like a video game, I had to progress to the next level. This continued on for a few weeks. In my excitement I would check current jobs listings and determine which languages were popular and make sure that those were the ones I was learning. There was one problem with this, jobs listings required their candidates to know quite a few languages. I began feeling alone on my journey. I didn’t have anyone to share my progress with and I didn’t know where to look for inspiration or advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My initial thoughts of this being an impossibility returned. How could I learn all of this while working full-time. Surely it would take years! This feeling really dampened my mood. I stopped coding for quite some time and started to accept that trying to become a software developer wasn’t really feasible.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later that year I would finally complete a life long goal of mine to move to Manchester, England. The excitement of moving to a new country had me feeling energized. The canvas was blank. I could do anything. This is where I’d start my life anew and work to establish a solid career…&lt;/p&gt;
