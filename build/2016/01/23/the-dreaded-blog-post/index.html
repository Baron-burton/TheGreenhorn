      <p>It takes a bit more courage than I imagined to write a blog post. I don’t have much experience writing anything that merits any consideration whatsoever, other than some work I did in university (this was barely considered by my professor). It’s intimidating to say the least. It’s difficult to tame your thoughts into a coherent text, let alone one that might be remotely enjoyable to read. Nevertheless, I push on!  </p>

<p>My purpose for endeavouring to write a blog is to convey my experiences while learning to code. Learning to write code for the first time is daunting. Where do you begin? How do you know where you’re beginning is right? What dictates the amount of knowledge required to begin a new career? These are a few questions that I’ve asked myself. The answers to these questions change over time as new languages emerge and new portals of learning are created.   </p>

<p>My first thoughts were that it wouldn’t be possible to truly learn how to code without a degree in Computer Science, that becoming a software developer was reserved for a select few following a path carefully constructed by accomplished professors. Due to this, I thought it would also be impossible for me to get a job unless I started fresh in school. To my great surprise, I thought I’d discovered another way.</p>

<p>I started my journey a few years ago, not unlike many in this generation, with an online tutorial. The one in particular was CodeAcademy. It had a few languages to choose from (HTML and CSS were the first ones I picked), it didn’t require any setup, and, best of all, it was free! I was really excited. I came home from work and would practice for hours a night. It was like a video game, I had to progress to the next level. This continued on for a few weeks. In my excitement I would check current jobs listings and determine which languages were popular and make sure that those were the ones I was learning. There was one problem with this, jobs listings required their candidates to know quite a few languages. I began feeling alone on my journey. I didn’t have anyone to share my progress with and I didn’t know where to look for inspiration or advice.</p>

<p>My initial thoughts of this being an impossibility returned. How could I learn all of this while working full-time. Surely it would take years! This feeling really dampened my mood. I stopped coding for quite some time and started to accept that trying to become a software developer wasn’t really feasible.   </p>

<p>Later that year I would finally complete a life long goal of mine to move to Manchester, England. The excitement of moving to a new country had me feeling energized. The canvas was blank. I could do anything. This is where I’d start my life anew and work to establish a solid career…</p>
